# Spontaneous Trip Generator

A simple full-stack web app to inspire spontaneous travel! Click a button to get a random destination for the selected country and a short description.

---

## Features
- **React + Vite + Tailwind CSS** frontend
- **Django REST API** backend (no database required for MVP)
- Fetches a random destination for the selected country
- **Dynamic hero images**: The hero section updates with a beautiful Unsplash photo relevant to the selected country
- **Country flag overlay**: The hero section displays the selected country's flag
- **Multi-country support**: Choose from a list of countries to generate spontaneous trips worldwide
- **AI-powered descriptions**: Uses Claude AI to generate engaging city descriptions and provide clickable links to top tourist attractions
- **Firebase Authentication** (Email/Password & Google OAuth) via Firebase

---

## Claude AI Integration

This app uses [Claude AI](https://www.anthropic.com/products/claude) to generate:
- Rich, vibrant travel descriptions for each destination
- 2â€“4 clickable links to popular local attractions (official or trusted sources)
- All descriptions and links are generated server-side and delivered via the backend API

**Environment Variables:**
- Backend requires a `CLAUDE_API_KEY` in `backend/.env` for Claude API access.
- See `.env.example` for setup.

**Frontend Experience:**
- Users see a preview of the AI description and can expand to read the full text
- Attraction links are always clickable and open in a new tab
- An "ðŸ¤– Powered by Claude AI" badge is shown on every description
- The hero image and flag update instantly when you select a new country
- Responsive and visually polished UI, with robust fallback for images

## Firebase Authentication Integration

This app now uses [Firebase Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth) for secure login, signup, and Google sign-in. Users can create accounts, sign in, and manage their profile securely.

### Firebase Setup
1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a project.
2. Enable Authentication (Email/Password and Google sign-in).
3. In your Firebase project settings, get your web app config.
4. Copy the config to `frontend/src/firebase.js` (replace the placeholders):
   ```js
   const firebaseConfig = {
     apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
     authDomain: "YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN",
     projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
     storageBucket: "YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET",
     messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
     appId: "YOUR_APP_ID"
   };
   ```
5. Add your domain (e.g., `localhost`) to the Firebase Auth sign-in methods for development.

## Agile User Story

**As a** spontaneous traveler,
**I want** to click a button and instantly receive a random destination for the selected country with a brief description,
**so that** I can discover new travel destinations without having to plan in advance.

---

## Iterations (Agile Sprints)

**Iteration 1: MVP Delivery**
- Set up backend with Django REST API to serve random destinations (hardcoded list)
- Create frontend with React + Vite + Tailwind CSS
- Implement UI: button to get a destination, display city name and description
- Connect frontend to backend API
- Basic error handling and loading states

**Iteration 2: Enhancements**
- Dynamic hero image and country flag in hero section
- Support for multiple countries (not just Canada)
- Allow user to filter by province/region
- Improve UI/UX with animations and responsive design
- Add more destinations to the backend

**Iteration 3: Expansion**
- Dynamic country-based hero images and flags
- Add support for more countries/regions
- Allow users to save favorite destinations (requires backend/db changes)
- Prepare for deployment (hosting, environment variables, etc.)

---

## MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

The MVP includes:
- A working frontend where users can click a button to receive a random destination for the selected country and its description
- A Django backend that returns a random destination from a hardcoded list (no database required)
- Simple, clean UI using React and Tailwind CSS
- No authentication, user accounts, or persistent storage
- Basic error handling for failed API requests

This MVP allows users to immediately experience the core valueâ€”discovering spontaneous travel ideasâ€”while keeping the implementation simple and focused. Future iterations can expand on features and destinations as needed.

## Quickstart

### Backend (Django)
1. **Create a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Run the server:**
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver 8000
   ```
   The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000/api/random-destination/`

### Frontend (React + Vite)
1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```
2. **Configure Firebase:**
   - Follow the [Firebase Setup](#firebase-authentication-integration) instructions above.
3. **Run the dev server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   The app will be available at the URL shown in your terminal (usually `http://localhost:5173`).

## Notes
- Firebase Authentication is now required for login/signup. See the section above for setup.
- To add more countries or destinations, update the backend hardcoded list in `trips/views.py`.
- For deployment, further configuration will be needed.
