# Spontaneous Trip Generator

A simple full-stack web app to inspire spontaneous travel! Click a button to get a random Canadian city and a short description.

---

## Features
- **React + Vite + Tailwind CSS** frontend
- **Django REST API** backend (no database required for MVP)
- Fetches a random Canadian destination on demand
- **AI-powered descriptions**: Uses Claude AI to generate engaging city descriptions and provide clickable links to top tourist attractions

---

## Claude AI Integration

This app uses [Claude AI](https://www.anthropic.com/products/claude) to generate:
- Rich, vibrant travel descriptions for each destination
- 2â€“4 clickable links to popular local attractions (official or trusted sources)
- All descriptions and links are generated server-side and delivered via the backend API

**Environment Variables:**
- Backend requires a `CLAUDE_API_KEY` in `backend/.env` for Claude API access.
- See `.env.example` for setup.

**Frontend Experience:**
- Users see a preview of the AI description and can expand to read the full text
- Attraction links are always clickable and open in a new tab
- An "ðŸ¤– Powered by Claude AI" badge is shown on every description

## Agile User Story

**As a** spontaneous traveler,
**I want** to click a button and instantly receive a random Canadian city with a brief description,
**so that** I can discover new travel destinations without having to plan in advance.

## Iterations (Agile Sprints)

**Iteration 1: MVP Delivery**
- Set up backend with Django REST API to serve random Canadian destinations (hardcoded list)
- Create frontend with React + Vite + Tailwind CSS
- Implement UI: button to get a destination, display city name and description
- Connect frontend to backend API
- Basic error handling and loading states

**Iteration 2: Enhancements**
- Add images for destinations
- Allow user to filter by province/region
- Improve UI/UX with animations and responsive design
- Add more destinations to the backend

**Iteration 3: Expansion**
- Add support for more countries/regions
- Allow users to save favorite destinations (requires backend/db changes)
- Prepare for deployment (hosting, environment variables, etc.)

## MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

The MVP includes:
- A working frontend where users can click a button to receive a random Canadian city and its description
- A Django backend that returns a random destination from a hardcoded list (no database required)
- Simple, clean UI using React and Tailwind CSS
- No authentication, user accounts, or persistent storage
- Basic error handling for failed API requests

This MVP allows users to immediately experience the core valueâ€”discovering spontaneous travel ideasâ€”while keeping the implementation simple and focused. Future iterations can expand on features and destinations as needed.

## Quickstart

### Backend (Django)
1. **Create a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Run the server:**
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver 8000
   ```
   The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000/api/random-destination/`

### Frontend (React + Vite)
1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```
2. **Run the dev server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   The app will be available at the URL shown in your terminal (usually `http://localhost:5173`).
